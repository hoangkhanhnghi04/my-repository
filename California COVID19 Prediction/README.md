# CREDIT RISK ANALYSIS

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to find key features that have a correlation with predicting, and modeling future COVID-19 cases in the state of California. 
There currently exist models that attempt to tackle this question, but they are primarily focused on a country level and are limited in feature scope.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Jupyter Notebook 

## Project Description
The COVID-19 pandemic has been ongoing for a couple of years now and continues to
disrupt nearly all aspects of everyday life. The purpose of this project is to find key features that
have a correlation with predicting, and modeling future COVID-19 cases in the state of
California. There currently exist models that attempt to tackle this question, but they are
primarily focused on a country level and are limited in feature scope. The project approaches this
challenge by adapting a diverse set of features with a particular focus on demographics for
California. The project methods incorporate the use of five different datasets; Weather,
COVID-19 Cases and deaths and tests, COVID-19 Hospital, COVID-19 Vaccination by
Demographics, and COVID-19 Deaths by Demographics.
The objectives of the project are shown as follows:
- Conduct data preparation (e.g., data cleaning, data preprocessing) to clean and transform
the dataset.
- Conduct data exploration to understand the dataset and observe any patterns or possible
relationships among the variables.
- Implement a variety of machine learning algorithms, including  Linear Regression,
Random Forest, XGBoost, and Prophet.
- Evaluate and compare different models using MSE and RMSE
- Deploy the models

## Needs of this project
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
