# DRUG CONSUMPTION ANALYSIS

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is aims to classify peopleâ€™s credit card status from input information on their personal information using five different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbors, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Ensemble Voting Classifie. The oversampling method Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and the feature selection technique Recursive Feature Elimination, Cross-Validated (RFECV) are used to improve the efficiency of the predictions.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Jupyter Notebook 

## Project Description
Drug consumption is a common habit in the United States, with some being illegal and
others being legal, such as nicotine and alcohol. With both types of drug consumption
significantly affecting local communities, much research has been done on the topic. One
popular branch of research is to determine if there are pre-determined characteristics that make
an individual likely to consume a drug or characteristics that make them more susceptible to
prolonged drug addiction. We chose this topic because of the plentiful amount of raw data
available to us and the ability for us to personally see if our project results match with what is
reported or observed in our local community.
The objectives of the project are shown as follows:

Our data is Drug consumption (quantified) obtained from UC Irvine Machine Learning
Repository. What interests us about this dataset is that the data uses personality measurements of
the drug user. The personality measurements are EO-FFI-R (neuroticism, extraversion, openness
to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness), BIS-11 (impulsivity), and ImpSS
(sensation seeking). Outside of the personality measurements, we have the drug users' age,
ethnicity, gender, education, and country of residence; six features.
The objectives of the project are shown as follows:
- Conduct data preparation (e.g., data cleaning, data preprocessing) to clean and transform
the dataset.
- Conduct data exploration to understand the dataset and observe any patterns or possible
relationships among the variables.
- Implement Logistic Regression Combined Hypothesis Test and Correlation-based feature selection methods
- Implement a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression,
Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.
- Evaluate and compare different models using accuracy score, precision score, f1 score, and recall score.

## Needs of this project
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
