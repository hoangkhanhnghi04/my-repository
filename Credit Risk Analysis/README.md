# CREDIT RISK ANALYSIS

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is aims to classify people’s credit card status from input information on their personal information using five different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbors, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Ensemble Voting Classifie. The oversampling method Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and the feature selection technique Recursive Feature Elimination, Cross-Validated (RFECV) are used to improve the efficiency of the predictions.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Jupyter Notebook 

## Project Description
Credit is the ability of an individual to borrow money or goods or services and pay back
at a later time, and credit cards are one of the most popular forms of credit. Undeniably, credit
plays an important role in pushing up the economy in the U.S. as people tend to spend more
when they use credit cards than when they use cash. However, if financial organizations don’t
take credit risk assessment seriously, the economy can bubble and explode. The target of the
project is to find the best machine learning method for credit risk modeling using a basic bank
details dataset that contains a vast array of credit-related information. The model classifies credit
scores into three categories: 0 stands for poor, 1 stands for standard, and 2 stands for good. This
will help financial institutions determine qualified candidates for any specific loans.
The objectives of the project are shown as follows:
- Conduct data preparation (e.g., data cleaning, data preprocessing) to clean and transform
the dataset.
- Conduct data exploration to understand the dataset and observe any patterns or possible
relationships among the variables.
- Implement a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression,
K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, XGBoosting, and Ensemble Voting Classifier.
- Implement all algorithms again with the synthetic minority oversampling technique
(SMOTE) function. The SMOTE function will re-distribute the training and testing
dataset with balanced portions of target categories.
- Perform feature selection technique Recursive Feature Elimination, Cross-Validated
(RFECV) and implement all algorithms one last time
- Evaluate and compare different models which are:
● pure (no SMOTE function and feature selection)
● applied the SMOTE function
● applied the SMOTE function and the RFECV feature selection technique.
- Deploy the models

## Needs of this project
