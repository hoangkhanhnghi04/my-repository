* Tableau

## Project Description
The wine sector is very competitive, and comprehending the aspects that play a role in
determining the quality of wine is crucial for triumph. The main purpose of this project is to
investigate a dataset on wine quality and identify the main factors that influence it. The dataset
contains chemical measurements of red and white wines, and the corresponding ratings for the
wine's quality. The project applies Random Forest algorithm to classify wine quality into three
categories: high, average, and low. The accuracy score of the model is about 61%, which can be
explained by the unbalanced target distribution and not strong correlations between independent
and dependent variables. The data is also explored using descriptive statistics and data
visualization techniques such as violin plots, swam plots, density plots, scatterplots, heat maps,
and bar charts. The purpose of the dashboards is to evaluate the Random Forestâ€™s result and
provide valuable insights about the factors that contribute to wine quality, such as wine
categories, or the levels of density, alcohol, residual sugar, and so forth. Moreover, winemakers
and marketers can make use of the visualizations to decide production, pricing, and marketing.
