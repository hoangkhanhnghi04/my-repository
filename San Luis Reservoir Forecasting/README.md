# WATER SUPPLY FORECASTING: SAN LUIS RESERVOIR

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The aim for this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict reservoir storage levels at San Luis Reservoir located in California east of Gilroy

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Jupyter Notebook 

## Project Description
CSan Luis Reservoir is chosen because it provides most of the imported water to Santa Clara County. 
Using similar research in other hydrological areas, we replicated and adjusted their machine learning models 
to handle data we procure for Santa Clara County water supply chain. Research on forecasting
reservoir storage levels utilized a combination, but not limited to, of input data parameters such
as meteorological, snowpack, and runoff. The retrieved data consists of date, precipitation,
temperature, snowmelt, and reservoir data because they are the main reservoir inputs for
California. XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boost (GB), and Support Vector Regression
(SVR) are the four machine learning algorithms used to perform predictions on reservoir storage
levels because of their ability to handle limited data and were found to be the best performing
repeatedly.
The objectives of the project are shown as follows:
- Conduct data preparation (e.g., data cleaning, data preprocessing) to clean and transform
the dataset.
- Conduct data exploration to understand the dataset and observe any patterns or possible
relationships among the variables.
- Implement a variety of machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Random Forest (RF),
Gradient Boost (GB), and Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Evaluate and compare different models which are coefficient of determination score, root mean square error,
- mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean error in percentage
- Deploy the models

## Needs of this project
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
