### Technologies
* Jupyter Notebook 

## Project Description
Several researchers have been applying a diversity of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques to classify news articles. Understanding the importance of handling an
enormous amount of text from various resources, this project is studied to help readers and
researchers save time gathering useful information from English articles. The study of this
paper differs from others by creating a combined system that is capable of classifying news
topics, recognizing named entities, and summarizing the article content. Leveraging the power
of multiple pre-trained models including BERT, RoBERTa, ERNIE, ELECTRA, T5, and
BART, the research encompasses the mentioned tasks. The niche of this research is the
implementation of Progressive Ensemble Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Query-Level Optimization
with Reinforcement learning Algorithm (QLoRA) has further enhanced the abstractive
summarization task. 

After rigorous evaluation processes, this research has found that ERNIE is
the best model for Text Classification task with 85.34% accuracy, ELECTRA is the best
performance of 98.65% accuracy for Named Entity Recognition task, and Flan-T5-Small has
reached 0.3438 in Rouge-1 and 0.3280 in Rouge-L for Abstractive Summarization task. This
endeavor not only showcases the versatility of state-of-the-art NLP models, but also culminates
in the delivery of an advanced news analyzing application
